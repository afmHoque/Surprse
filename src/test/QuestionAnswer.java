    /*  A singleton class is a class that can have only one object
        (an instance of the class) at a time.
     *  The Singleton's purpose is to control object creation,
        limiting the number of objects to only one.
     *  Since there is only one Singleton instance, any instance fields
        of a Singleton will occur only once per class, just like static fields.
